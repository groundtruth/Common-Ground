# Common Ground

Common Ground is a MapInfo plugin (MBX) that enables Victorian councils to update, correct and track changes to their property map base. Specifically, it provides a graphical interface to guide council staff in compiling the required information to complete the 'M1' spreadsheet for submitting to the state government.

*Note: Common Ground is considered a semi-manual method of filling in M1s. For a more automated solution, see Groundtruth's Pozi Connect for M1s.*

## Intallation

The Common Ground.mbx and associated files typically reside on a network drive where it is accessible to multiple users.

The following instructions assume that these files have already been set up on your network by Groundtruth, and that you're wanting to make it accessible for a new user or new PC.
